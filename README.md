# Wallet Ledger Dashboard
# About

This project is an implementation of a Wallet Ledger Dashboard built with React and TypeScript, based on a Figma design specification. It focuses on recreating the dashboard view with a clean UI, interactivity, responsive design, and accessibility in mind.

# Key Highlights
Accessibility & Inclusivity (a11y): Developed with a strong focus on inclusivity, ensuring the dashboard caters to keyboard users, mouse users, and screen readers through assistive technologies built into the website.

Performance & Core Web Vitals: Prioritized performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices.

Optimized Loading Times: Achieved First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) times of 0.7 seconds each (based on Lighthouse reports), which are well within Googleâ€™s recommended range for excellent user experience.

Responsive Design: Mobile-first approach, adapting seamlessly across all screen sizes.


# Features

Summary Cards for Total Balance, Credits, Debits, and Transactions.

Sortable Transaction Table with date, remark, amount, currency, and transaction type indicators.

Color-Coded Transactions: Green for credits, red for debits.
